d-note
======

Introduction
------------

d-note is a self destructing notes application you can run on your own web
server. I got the idea from a number of websites doing pretty much the same
thing:

* https://oneshar.es/
* https://privnote.com/
* https://quickforget.com/
* https://burnnote.com/
* https://secretink.co/

And many more. Unfortunately, none of the above sites seem to be interested
in benefiting the community as a whole by providing their source code, even
though there seems to be a demand for it. Further, by using a third party
service, you have no guarantee that they are not sharing your data with
third parties. By running your own server, you know who has your data and
who doesn't.

The name of the project is inspired by the "H-Bomb", or hydrogen bomb. I
wanted a clever name for self destructing notes that was not in use, and
something that had a familiar ring to it. "d-note" seemed to fit for
"destructive note", and as already mentioned, inspired by the hydrogen
bomb.
